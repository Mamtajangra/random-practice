# - Operation 2: num1 = 2, num2 = 1. Since num1 > num2, we subtract num2 from num1.
# - Operation 3: num1 = 1, num2 = 1. Since num1 == num2, we subtract num2 from num1.
# Now num1 = 0 and num2 = 1. Since num1 == 0, we do not need to perform any further operations.
# So the total number of operations required is 3.
